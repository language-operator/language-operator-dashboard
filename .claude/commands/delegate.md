# Delegate: triage unassigned work into queues

## Prerequisites

Read:
- `requirements/personas/project-manager.md`
- `requirements/MEMORY.md`

Adopt the project-manager persona.

## Instructions

1. Count open issues with no queue label and not `in-progress`:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/commands/delegate/list-unqueued-issues.sh
   ```

2. If **no unassigned issues** are found, report idle and stop.

3. If unassigned issues **are** found:
   - Check how many open issues each queue currently has:
     ```bash
     bash .claude/commands/delegate/check-queue-capacity.sh
     ```
   - For each queue that has **0 open issues**, pick the single highest-priority unassigned issue that fits that queue's conflict group and assign it
   - Do not assign to a queue that already has an open issue — it is not ready to receive new work yet
   - Apply labels: `gh issue edit <N> --add-label "queue/X"`

4. Report a summary: which queues were refilled and with which issue, and which queues were skipped (still have work).

## Loop

After completing step 4, wait 1 minute and repeat from step 1. Run indefinitely until stopped.
