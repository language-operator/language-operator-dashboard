# Action: do the next logical piece of work

## Prerequisites

Please read the following context files:

* Project: CLAUDE.md
* Persona: requirements/personas/js-engineer.md
* Memory: requirements/MEMORY.md

## Persona

**CRITICAL**: Adopt the given persona while executing these instructions, please.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` is either:
- A queue number to work from: `0`, `1`, or `2`
- A specific issue reference: `#123`, `issue #123`, or bare `123`

## Instructions

Follow these directions closely:

1. Determine the issue to work on based on `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - **If it looks like an issue ID** (contains `#` or is a plain integer ≥ 10, e.g. `#123`, `issue #123`, `123`):
     Parse out the number N and fetch it directly: `gh issue view <N> --json number,title,labels,state`
     - If the issue is closed or not found, report and stop.
     - Read its comments as well: `gh issue view <N> --comments`
     - Note: since this issue was not pulled from a queue, skip the queue-label removal in step 3 and pass an empty string for `<queue-number>` to `start-issue.sh`.
   - **Otherwise** treat `$ARGUMENTS` as a queue label:
     `gh issue list --label "queue/$ARGUMENTS" --state open --json number,title,labels --limit 1`
     - If no issue is found, report idle and stop.
     - If found, read its comments as well.
2. Investigate if the issue is valid, or a mis-use of the intended feature.
3. **CRITICAL:** Switch to plan mode, and propose an implementation plan. Await my feedback before touching any files or creating any worktree.
4. **Label and create worktree** in one step. Determine a short slug (2-4 words) from the issue title, then:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/commands/iterate/start-issue.sh <N> <short-slug> <queue-number>
   ```
   The script labels the issue `in-progress`, removes the queue label, and creates a worktree. It prints `worktree:<path>` — `cd` into that path. All subsequent work happens inside this worktree. Do not `cd` out of it.
5. Implement your plan inside the worktree.
7. Run existing tests and add new ones if necessary: `npm test`
8. Commit with a semantic, ONE LINE message like `fix: remove executionMode dead code` and push the branch — run as two separate commands, do not use inline variable assignments:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/commands/iterate/push-branch.sh <branch-name>
   ```
9. Open a pull request: `gh pr create --title "<commit message>" --body "Closes #<N>"`. Use conventional commit style for the PR title.
10. **CRITICAL:** Poll CI on the PR: `gh pr checks <PR-number> --watch`. Fix any failing checks before proceeding.
11. When all checks pass, merge: `gh pr merge <PR-number> --squash --delete-branch`.
12. Clean up the worktree (run from inside it — no arguments needed):
    ```bash
    bash .claude/commands/iterate/remove-worktree.sh
    ```
13. Remove the `in-progress` label, add a comment with resolution details, then close the issue:
    ```bash
    gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "in-progress"
    gh issue comment <N> --body "<resolution details>"
    gh issue close <N>
    ```
14. Consider if you need to update `requirements/MEMORY.md` for the next run. It's not a changelog — it's for things you may forget.
15. If `$ARGUMENTS` was a queue number (not a specific issue ID), check for remaining issues:
    `gh issue list --label "queue/$ARGUMENTS" --state open --json number --limit 1`
    - If issues remain, loop back to step 1 to pick up the next one.
    - If the queue is empty, report idle and stop.
    - If `$ARGUMENTS` was a specific issue ID, stop here.

## Output

A merged PR, test coverage, updated CI, and a closed ticket.
